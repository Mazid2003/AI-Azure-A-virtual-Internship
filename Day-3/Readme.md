Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning inspired by the structure of the human brain (neural networks).

It involves multiple layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in large datasets.

**🚀 Applications of Deep Learning:**

**🤖 What is Generative AI?**

Generative AI refers to systems that can create new content — text, images, audio, code — by learning patterns from existing data.

Examples include ChatGPT, DALL·E, Bard, Midjourney, etc.

**🧩 Applications of Generative AI:**

- Text Generation: Chatbots, article creation, auto-emailing

- Image Generation: AI art, style transfer, design assistance

- Music & Video: AI music composition, video creation

- Code Generation: AI-powered programming assistants

- Healthcare: Drug discovery, report generation

**🛠 Generative AI Tools:**

- OpenAI (ChatGPT, DALL·E)

- Google Gemini / Bard

- Microsoft Copilot

- Runway ML, Midjourney, Jasper AI

- Hugging Face Transformers

**⚙️ How Generative AI Works:**

- Trained on massive datasets using transformer-based models like GPT

- Learns patterns, context, and relationships between data

- Uses probabilistic modeling to generate new, coherent content

**🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs):**

LLMs like GPT-4, BERT, LLaMA, and PaLM are deep learning models trained on billions of words

They understand and generate human-like text across domains

**✍️ Text Generation:**

The process of producing coherent, context-aware text using a trained model

Involves predicting the next word/token based on previous ones

**🔍 How Text Generation Works:**

Input prompt is tokenized

Model predicts the next token using learned weights

Generated tokens are combined to form human-like responses

Uses techniques like beam search, temperature, and top-k sampling for control
