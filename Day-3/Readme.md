**🗓 Day 4: Deep Learning & Generative AI**

Date: 15/05/2025

**Summary:**

Today's session focused on the advanced concepts of Deep Learning and the trending domain of Generative AI. We explored how deep learning powers intelligent systems and how generative models are shaping the future of creativity and automation.

**Topics Covered:**

**🧠 What is Deep Learning?**

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning inspired by the structure of the human brain (neural networks).

It involves multiple layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in large datasets.

**🚀 Applications of Deep Learning:**

- Computer Vision: Image classification, face recognition, object detection

- Natural Language Processing: Machine translation, sentiment analysis

- Healthcare: Tumor detection, disease prediction

- Autonomous Vehicles: Lane detection, decision-making

- Finance: Credit scoring, fraud detection

**📚 Some Reference Materials:**

- Coursera Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng

- TensorFlow and PyTorch official documentation

- DeepLearning.ai Blog

- Books: "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow

**🤖 What is Generative AI?**

Generative AI refers to systems that can create new content — text, images, audio, code — by learning patterns from existing data.

Examples include ChatGPT, DALL·E, Bard, Midjourney, etc.

**🧩 Applications of Generative AI:**

- Text Generation: Chatbots, article creation, auto-emailing

- Image Generation: AI art, style transfer, design assistance

- Music & Video: AI music composition, video creation

- Code Generation: AI-powered programming assistants

- Healthcare: Drug discovery, report generation

**🛠 Generative AI Tools:**

- OpenAI (ChatGPT, DALL·E)

- Google Gemini / Bard

- Microsoft Copilot

- Runway ML, Midjourney, Jasper AI

- Hugging Face Transformers

**⚙️ How Generative AI Works:**

- Trained on massive datasets using transformer-based models like GPT

- Learns patterns, context, and relationships between data

- Uses probabilistic modeling to generate new, coherent content

**🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs):**

LLMs like GPT-4, BERT, LLaMA, and PaLM are deep learning models trained on billions of words

They understand and generate human-like text across domains

**✍️ Text Generation:**

The process of producing coherent, context-aware text using a trained model

Involves predicting the next word/token based on previous ones

**🔍 How Text Generation Works:**

Input prompt is tokenized

Model predicts the next token using learned weights

Generated tokens are combined to form human-like responses

Uses techniques like beam search, temperature, and top-k sampling for control
