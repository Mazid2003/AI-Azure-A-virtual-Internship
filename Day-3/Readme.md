Generative AI refers to systems that can create new content — text, images, audio, code — by learning patterns from existing data.

Examples include ChatGPT, DALL·E, Bard, Midjourney, etc.

- Trained on massive datasets using transformer-based models like GPT

- Learns patterns, context, and relationships between data

- Uses probabilistic modeling to generate new, coherent content

### 🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs):

LLMs like GPT-4, BERT, LLaMA, and PaLM are deep learning models trained on billions of words

They understand and generate human-like text across domains

The process of producing coherent, context-aware text using a trained model

Involves predicting the next word/token based on previous ones

Input prompt is tokenized

Model predicts the next token using learned weights

Generated tokens are combined to form human-like responses

Uses techniques like beam search, temperature, and top-k sampling for control
