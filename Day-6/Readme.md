# üóì Day - 6 : Generative AIüöÄ

Date:22/05/2025

This session introduced us to the rapidly evolving world of Generative AI (Gen AI) and its applications across industries. Below is a comprehensive overview of the concepts and tools we explored:

## ü§ñ What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to models that can create new content such as text, images, code, and audio. These models learn from vast datasets and generate outputs that mimic human-like creativity and intelligence.

Gen AI models use deep learning, especially transformers, trained on massive data. They predict the next token (word, pixel, etc.) based on context.

## üß† What is an LLM?

![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-23 at 11 58 40 AM (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aafd4400-aa13-44fb-a10a-e9a5003b76c3)

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of Gen AI model trained on a large corpus of text data. It understands and generates human language. GPT, BERT, and LLaMA are examples.

## Gen AI vs LLM

![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-23 at 11 58 34 AM (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b1a60cb-0c91-4b0a-8a4c-8f588be974a0)

LLMs are a subset of Gen AI focused on language understanding and generation.

Gen AI includes text, image, audio, and video generation models, including LLMs and others.

## üß™ Discriminative vs Generative AI

![WhatsApp Image 2025-05-23 at 11 58 34 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55a620dc-5781-4b2f-b5d9-85e0b27ebabc)

Discriminative: Classifies input (e.g., is this a cat or a dog?).

Generative: Creates new data (e.g., generate a picture of a dog).

## üßæ Text Generation

LLMs like GPT generate human-like text using token prediction and attention mechanisms.

Tools: GPT-4, Bard, Claude, ChatGPT.
