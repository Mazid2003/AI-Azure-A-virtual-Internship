**Day-6:Generative AI**

Date:22/05/2025

This session introduced us to the rapidly evolving world of Generative AI (Gen AI) and its applications across industries. Below is a comprehensive overview of the concepts and tools we explored:

**🤖 What is Generative AI?**

Generative AI refers to models that can create new content such as text, images, code, and audio. These models learn from vast datasets and generate outputs that mimic human-like creativity and intelligence.

Gen AI models use deep learning, especially transformers, trained on massive data. They predict the next token (word, pixel, etc.) based on context.

**🧠 What is an LLM?**

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of Gen AI model trained on a large corpus of text data. It understands and generates human language. GPT, BERT, and LLaMA are examples.

**🆚 Gen AI vs LLM**

LLMs are a subset of Gen AI focused on language understanding and generation.

Gen AI includes text, image, audio, and video generation models, including LLMs and others.

**🧪 Discriminative vs Generative AI**

Discriminative: Classifies input (e.g., is this a cat or a dog?).

Generative: Creates new data (e.g., generate a picture of a dog).

**🧾 Text Generation**

LLMs like GPT generate human-like text using token prediction and attention mechanisms.

Tools: GPT-4, Bard, Claude, ChatGPT.

**🖼️ Image Generation**

Converts textual descriptions into realistic or stylized images using diffusion or GAN-based models.

Tools: DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney.

**👨‍💻 Code Generation**

Code generators turn natural language prompts into functional code.

Tools: GitHub Copilot, CodeWhisperer, ChatGPT Code Interpreter.

**💬 Prompt Engineering**

Prompt: The input or instruction given to a Gen AI model.

**Prompting Techniques**

Zero-Shot: No examples; rely solely on instruction.

One-Shot: One example is provided.

Few-Shot: A few examples are included in the prompt.

Negative Prompting: Specifies what not to generate.

Prompt Chaining: Using multiple prompts in sequence to refine output.

Chain-of-Thought: Guides the model to show intermediate reasoning steps.

Iterative Prompting: Repeatedly refining prompts based on outputs.
