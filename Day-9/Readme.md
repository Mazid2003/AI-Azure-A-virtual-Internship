Unsupervised Learning is a machine learning approach where the model is trained on unlabeled data.
The algorithm tries to discover patterns, groupings, or structure in the input data without being given explicit labels or outputs.

### Key Characteristics:
No labeled outputs.

Goal is to explore data and find hidden structures.

Common tasks: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Anomaly Detection.

| Output Known? | Yes                        | No                             |
| Goal          | Predict output             | Discover patterns or groupings |

Clustering is the process of grouping a set of data points such that:

Points in the same group (cluster) are more similar to each other.

Points in different clusters are dissimilar.

It is a core task in unsupervised learning used to identify natural groupings in data.

## 1. ✅ K-Means Clustering
Partitioning algorithm that divides data into k clusters.

Works by minimizing the distance between data points and their cluster centroids.

Requires specifying k (number of clusters) in advance.

Fast and efficient, but sensitive to outliers and shape of data.

**2. 🧱 DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
Clusters data based on density of points.

Groups together closely packed points and marks low-density points as noise/outliers.

Doesn’t require number of clusters beforehand.

Can find arbitrarily shaped clusters and handles noise well.

**K-Means vs DBSCAN**
| Feature             | K-Means                | DBSCAN                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Clusters Shape      | Spherical              | Arbitrary                      |
| Need to specify `k` | Yes                    | No                             |
| Handles Outliers    | Poor                   | Very good                      |
| Based on Density    | No                     | Yes                            |
| Performance         | Fast on large datasets | Slower on large noisy datasets |

**3. 🌲 Hierarchical Clustering**

Builds a tree of clusters (dendrogram).

Two types:

Agglomerative: Bottom-up approach (merges clusters).

Divisive: Top-down approach (splits clusters).

No need to specify number of clusters initially.

Good for visualizing relationships among data points.
