      - Supervised Learning (uses labeled data)

      - Unsupervised Learning (finds hidden patterns in data)

      - Reinforcement Learning (decision making via rewards/punishments)

Supervised Learning – In Depth:


Unsupervised Learning 


Reinforcement Learning


**Types of Supervised Learining**

Regression vs Classification

Use cases: price prediction, sentiment analysis, spam detection, etc.

Types of Algorithms:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machines (SVM)


💻 Hands-On Project: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Key Learnings:

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Feature selection

Training a Linear Regression model

Evaluating with metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² Score

📈 This session helped me build a solid foundation in machine learning and prepared me for more advanced algorithms and real-time projects ahead!
