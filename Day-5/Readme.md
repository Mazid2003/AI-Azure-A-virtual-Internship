**🗓 📘Day 5 – Introduction to Machine Learning 🚀**

**Date:20/05/2025**

On Day 5 of my internship, I delved into the exciting world of Machine Learning, gaining both theoretical and hands-on experience with its core components and applications.

**🧠 Topics Covered:**

Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)
Learned what ML is, its importance in today’s tech landscape, and how it differs from traditional programming.

**ML Landscape & Workflow**

Understood the end-to-end ML pipeline from data collection ➡️ preprocessing ➡️ model building ➡️ evaluation ➡️ deployment.

**Real-Time Case Studies in ML**

Explored practical use cases in agriculture, healthcare, finance, and e-commerce where ML drives real value.

**Types of Machine Learning:**

      - Supervised Learning (uses labeled data)

      - Unsupervised Learning (finds hidden patterns in data)

      - Reinforcement Learning (decision making via rewards/punishments)

Supervised Learning – In Depth:

Unsupervised Learning 

Reinforcement Learning

**Types of Supervised Learining**

Regression vs Classification

Use cases: price prediction, sentiment analysis, spam detection, etc.

Types of Algorithms:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machines (SVM)


💻 Hands-On Project: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Key Learnings:

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Feature selection

Training a Linear Regression model

Evaluating with metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² Score

📈 This session helped me build a solid foundation in machine learning and prepared me for more advanced algorithms and real-time projects ahead!
